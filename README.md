CRAPI Example
-------------

This is a small pair of example programs that illustrate the flow for
a client registration API (CRAPI).

The programs run using NodeJS (http://nodejs.org/), and don't use any
permanent data store.

To try it out, you'll need to run the client.js and server.js such
that each has its own hostname. They'll need to run on port 80 (I
didn't mess around with running on different ports).

It's available under Apache 2.0.
